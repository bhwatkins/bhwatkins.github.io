<p>Here are my comments on the Vanderbilt paper, FHIRChain: Applying Blockchain to Securely
and Scalably Share Clinical Data. 

Their Basic Question: is it feasible to use blockchain technologies to securely and scalably share healthcare data for improving collaborative clinical decision support?

Their focus is on building a collaborative platform for reviewing tumor data. I think they envision a group of providers all sharing access to a patients data as a care team. The key is that this team could be widely distributed around the globe and hence the need for a secure shared platform. 

They are assuming there will be miners to authenticate the blocks. I think that’s a flaw. We seem to be moving in the direction of a permissioned blockchain and I think that makes more sense for a private blockchain. Although part of their reasoning was to open the platform to as wide a user base as possible and they’ve already decided that their next effort will be on a permissioned blockchain. 

Their solution for handling patient identifiers seems flawed, but it’s so vague I can’t tell for sure. Their access control for providers was based on public keys.  

They are using the DApp to control access to specific parts of the patient record, and generate audit and log data.  

They are relying on FHIR as the common language across consumers of the data. 

They also settled on a hybrid of on chain and off chain storage of data. And assumed that small edits to the off chain data were “not a problem”. I think that breaks immutability and they kind of hand waved their way around it. We need to be more rigorous. It’s a serious concern and needs to be addressed. 

Careful use of hash values could solve the off-chain edit problem. 

They tried to solve the problem of erroneous data on the block chain with an MVC architecture but that’s not really a solution it’s an architecture. The fundamental problem remains: what do I do with erroneous data on the chain? If I add a corrected block later on, how do I tell consumers of the data that I did that? Do they have to keep checking or keep a separate list of “changed” blocks? Yuck. 

They were very good about drawing clear lines between the ONC requirements for a “Shared Nationwide Interoperability Roadmap" and their design. I really liked that part.
